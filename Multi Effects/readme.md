Multi Effect Pedal
===================

Multi-effects processors are an efficient way for guitar players to keep their pedal setups under control, and get a massive array of incredible sounds in one easy-to-carry package. Hobby guitarists appreciate multi-effects pedals for their ease of use and simple setup requirements, but for working musicians they can be a life saver. No more dragging a bag full of stomp boxes to a show and pulling your hair out trying to organize all the patch cords. With one, powerful multi-effects unit you get all the sounds you need, and you’ll go through a lot less gaffer tape.


Description

This projects is an application for the STM32F4 board...

Effects
----------
  >- Overdrive: An overdrive pedal seeks to replicate the sound of an overdriven tube amp. In the course of doing so, it often facilitates the real thing a little more quickly by pushing your amp into clipping a little earlier.
  
  >- Trémolo:  Is a trembling effect. This effect turns the volume of a signal up and down, creating a "shuddering" effect.
  
  >- Delay.
  
  >- Flanger.
  
  >- Octaver: Mix the input signal with a synthesised signal whose musical tone is an octave lower or higher than the original. The synthesised octave signal is derived from the original input signal by halving (octave-down) or doubling (octave-up) the frequency. 
  
  >- Chorus: Occurs when individual sounds with approximately the same timbre, and very similar pitch converge and are perceived as one. While similar sounds coming from multiple sources can occur naturally, as in the case of a choir or string orchestra,


Schematics
----------
The schematics for the analog coupling and decoupling are availble to use. This were designed and simulated in LTSpice. An Free circuit simulation software from Linear Tecnologies.
