Multi Effect Pedal
===================

Multi-effects processors are an efficient way for guitar players to keep their pedal setups under control, and get a massive array of incredible sounds in one easy-to-carry package. Hobby guitarists appreciate multi-effects pedals for their ease of use and simple setup requirements, but for working musicians they can be a life saver. No more dragging a bag full of stomp boxes to a show and pulling your hair out trying to organize all the patch cords. With one, powerful multi-effects unit you get all the sounds you need, and youâ€™ll go through a lot less gaffer tape.
